title: "Everything's a service"

This as a service, that as a service, it's all the rage. I've jumped on the bandwagon too, and am proud to announce today the release of
*Bingo As A Service*. You can thank me later.

Where to get the source: [https://github.com/apergos/bingo](https://github.com/apergos/bingo)

Note that this is really crappy javascript and css and html. My goal was to get it to work, not to be nice. But we do take pull requests, so you can help make it suck less.

Oh, you want to know how to *run* it. Silly me! First, the obligatory disclaimer: it's not as much of a service as all that. I've got it on GitHub's WebPages and they don't let you pass parameters in the url. This means that in order to get your custom bingo card, you're going to have to fill in some data in a form. Sorry about that! But we do have some presets available if one of them is a good starting point for you. And we also take pull requests. Hint hint!

Without further ado:

P.S. It's actually called "bingoid" and that's an inside joke. If you know, you know.
