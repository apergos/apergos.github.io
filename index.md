These are some crazy times we live in.

I used to think I was busy, in early November or so of 2016.  I was mistaken.

How did I find free time to set up these pages?  There is no free time.
Time is very expensive and getting more so by the minute.

Nonetheless, better to do it now when I'm already extremely
late to the party, than even later when the party's over.

You'll mostly find weird little tidbits stashed here so that
my laptop is not their sole location.  Good backups are good.

I have a few dreams, besides getting a normal night's sleep sometime in the next millenium.
Once such dream is to be able to point folks to a file that can be downloaded to their laptop
and with the addition of perhaps a search script, will give them access to the Wikipedia or
other Wikimedia project in the language of their choice, with all images included.

Another is to provide a downloadable mysqldb for each project and language, with reasonable
placeholders where user and other private data would be.  This database would "just work"
and could be used to serve the wiki locally or for research purposes, or for hosting
a mirror with new and cool features.  Annotations anybody?

Information is power, and if everyone has usable access to that information,
that translates into decentralization of power.  That's my bigger dream.
